CycleWay aims to connect Swiss cyclists, allowing them to discover new routes beyond their imagination!

Shortly after creating an account, a cyclist can browse all available routes and select one or more. Also, our tool details some route properties such as the height difference or the length. You discovered a problem within the route? Let us and other cyclists know through our reporting service.

As for now, only administrators can edit and create new routes, by drawing them on a fully intuitive map.

Some boring, dull description is not explicit enough for you ? We got you; follow this link to gaze at our immersive prototype : https://www.figma.com/proto/YPwBniwmKTw6KvBQrTgORd/Untitled?node-id=4%3A104&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=0%3A3.

CycleWay is developped in academic context at HES-SO Valais/Wallis.
